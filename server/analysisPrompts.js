SEARCH KEYWORDS TO LOOK FOR:
background, clearance, security, badge, FBI, drug test, screening, access, escort, HSPD, PIV, credential, classified, confidential, restricted, authorized personnel, identification, ID card

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you find a requirement, extract the EXACT wording from the spec
- Include section numbers where found (e.g., "Section 01 35 00")
- If something is NOT specified, write "NOT SPECIFIED" 
- If this seems like a facility that SHOULD have security requirements but none are found, note: "‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No security requirements found - unusual for [nuclear/airport/government] facility. Verify with owner."
- DO NOT make assumptions - only report what's explicitly stated

If absolutely no security requirements are found, state:
"NO SECURITY OR ACCESS REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN DIVISIONS 00 & 01"`;
